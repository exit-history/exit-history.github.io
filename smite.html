<p>I was on leave for 3 more days. It's a Friday morning and we decide to start a Baldur's Gate 3 (multiplayer) adventure.</p>
<p>Let's start with an hour. Maybe and hour and a half.</p>
<img src="Smite\P000.png" width="464" height="334" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>We played for almost 8 hours straight.</p>
<p>And so it began:</p>
<p>A couple of half-breeds. The half-elf with blue hair (Bloof) and the half-orc Paladin (Smite).</p>
<img src="Smite\P001.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>Screenshots were mentioned on Discord, so we posed for one proper... in front of a sphincter.</p>
<img src="Smite\P002.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>A close-up of Smite learning how to play the Lute.</p>
<img src="Smite\P003.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>And again. Good times. Here we were travelling with Gale and Lae'zel.</p>
<img src="Smite\P004.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>Can't do a close-up of Smite without taking a look at Bloof.</p>
<img src="Smite\P005.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>An action shot of the party (now featuring Karlach) below the Blighted Village taking on spiders and ettercaps.</p>
<img src="Smite\P006.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>Here I (Gale) am, finding out the hard way to make sure I'm not wearing armour I'm not proficient in.</p>
<img src="Smite\P007.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>Phalar Aluve. Come to me, my precious. This shrieking sword was something Bloof wanted for his Cleric build.</p>
<img src="Smite\P008.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>Adventuring is hard work. At one point, Smite's hair started falling out.</p>
<img src="Smite\P009.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>With Minthara and the other leaders of the Goblin Camp dead, Bloof thought it would be a good idea to wear her camp clothing.</p>
<img src="Smite\P010.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>The Bulette took us by surprise... it had a rather nasty legendary action. But we survived.</p>
<img src="Smite\P011.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>Our run was in jeopardy when we decided to take Raphael's armour. The Oathbreaker Knight (and our entire camp!) didn't like that.</p>
<img src="Smite\P012.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>Bloof hid in a corner, and we live to fight another day. Our dog Scratch died though.</p>
<img src="Smite\P013.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>Another look at Bloof in his camp clothing. And some foreshadowing (notice Wyll in the background). Bloof doesn't like Wyll.</p>
<img src="Smite\P014.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>Smite kept his Oath for all of five minutes in this playthrough. Here he paid his way back into the Knight's good graces.</p>
<img src="Smite\P015.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>So that he could steal from Raphael... with Gale casting Darkness. But this time, we got away with it.</p>
<img src="Smite\P016.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>We travelled to the Underdark. This is moments before Bloof sacrificed Wyll to BOOOAL, muahaha.</p>
<img src="Smite\P017.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>Here, Smite the Oathsworn Paladin distracts an innocent deep gnome while Karlach steals from her.</p>
<img src="Smite\P018.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>This fight scared us. We fought fire with... cheese (and Google/YouTube) and scored some sweet armour and a shield.</p>
<img src="Smite\P019.png" width="1280" height="720" style="border: 1px solid white;">
<p>Next stop... the mountain pass and Githyanki Creche.</p>
